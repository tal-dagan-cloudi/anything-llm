**Capability**: `legal-workflows`
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20

## Overview

This spec defines the Legal Workflows capability that provides pre-built and customizable multi-step legal processes for document analysis, compliance checks, due diligence, and other routine legal tasks.

## ADDED Requirements

### REQ-LW-001: Workflow Engine

**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None

The system SHALL provide a workflow execution engine that runs multi-step legal processes with support for branching logic, user review points, and error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Workflows defined as JSON with steps and dependencies
- Each step can invoke: LLM analysis, document parsing, external API, user prompt
- Branching logic based on step outcomes
- User review/approval gates between steps
- Progress tracking with real-time status updates (WebSocket)
- Automatic rollback on step failures

#### Scenario: Contract Review Workflow Execution

**Given** a contract review workflow with 5 steps:
1. Extract parties and dates
2. Identify key terms
3. Check compliance with standard clauses
4. Flag risks
5. Generate summary memo (requires user review)

**When** the workflow is launched with a contract PDF
**Then** the system:
- Executes steps 1-4 automatically
- Streams progress updates: "Step 1/5: Extracting parties... ‚úì"
- Pauses at step 5 with: "Review required before generating memo"
- User reviews flagged risks
- User approves or modifies
- Step 5 executes and generates final memo

**And If** step 3 fails (API error)
**Then** workflow pauses, logs error, and prompts: "Retry step 3 or skip?"
